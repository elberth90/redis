# redis

a simple and incomplete redis library

# Usage

You're best bet is to check the tests to see usage, as I'm awful at
documentation.

# Installation

Install the [Packagist archive](https://packagist.org/packages/henderjon/redis)
using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). I will *generally* respect
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Learn about how Composer
does [versions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#package-versions).

*Note the absense of v1.0*

```
{
	"require" : {
		"henderjon/redis": "dev-0.1.0"
	}
}
```
